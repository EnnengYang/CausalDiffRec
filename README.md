## Requirements

- torch==2.1.1+cu121  
- torch_geometric==2.5.3  
- torchaudio==2.1.1+cu121  
- torchvision==0.16.1+cu121

- dgl==2.0.0+cu121
 

## Run and reproduce

Run following python code (available dataset: "Yelp2018", "Douban") with default hyperparameters to reproduce our results.

```
python train.py --dataset yelp2018 
```
```
python train.py --dataset douban 
```

## Dataset


|  Dataset   |  #Users  |  #Items  |  #Interactions  |   Density   |
|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------------:|:-----------:|
|    Food    |  7,809   |  6,309   |     216,407     | 4.4 × 10⁻³  |
|  KuaiRec   |  7,175   |  10,611  |    1,153,797    | 1.5 × 10⁻³  |
|  Yelp2018  |  8,090   |  13,878  |     398,216     | 3.5 × 10⁻³  |
|   Douban   |  8,735   |  13,143  |     354,933     | 3.1 × 10⁻³  |


We retain only those users with at least 15 interactions on 
the Food dataset, at least 25 interactions on the Yelp2018 and
Douban datasets, and items with at least 50 interactions on 
these datasets. For all three datasets, only interactions 
with ratings of 4 or higher are considered positive samples. 
For the KuaiRec dataset, interactions with a watch ratio 
of 2 or higher are considered positive samples.
